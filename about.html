    <h1>About this website</h1>
    <p class="aboutP">This website is intended to help student paramedics (and any EMS provider) practice ALS scenarios
    where access to proper defibrillation/monitor equipement is not available. Basically, this is an education tool that
    helps practice ALS at home in your pyjamas.</p>
    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p class="aboutP">Sound effects from <a href="http://freesound.org/">freesound.org</a> and
        <a href="http://www.centrecountyfire.com/">centrecountyfire.com</a></p>
    <p class="aboutP">Javascript wave snippet from
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20400221/ecg-graph-with-html5-canvas">user "K3N" at Stack Overflow</a>
    </p>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p class="aboutP">Click settings and enter all the options you would like. Ideally, do this and close the settings
    tab so the resuscitator doesn't know the scenario. Press tab/the 'on' button and the scenario will play out. If you've
    completed a scenario and want to set up a new one, just turn the monitor off and enter the settings you want before
        refreshing the page.</p>
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
    <p class="aboutP">I wanted to find a way to make practicing ALS on a pillow a bit more realistic. After
    searching I couldn't find anything that suited my needs with the exception of some very expensive-looking software
        package I think HEMS use. Being a student spending money was out of the questions, so I made one.</p>
    <h3>Can I use this website in my class/on my course etc?</h3>
    <p class="aboutP">Of course! There are a few caveats, mainly don't charge access just to this site and I'm not liable for
    any inaccuracies. This website is provided in good faith and comes with no guarantee that it is accurate or 100% glitch
    free, although unlikely. Finally this site is not a substitute for proper ALS training and practice with real equipment,
    just a supplement for practice at home.</p>
    <h3>Can you add rhythm x/y/x?</h3>
    <p class="aboutP">Yes, in theory. As an ALS practice tool I wanted the main arrest rhythms at launch, but am open to
    adding more. Please contact me if you have a rhythm to suggest.</p>
    <h3>How do I share a scenario or save it for later?</h3>
    <p class="aboutP">As soon as you've entered all the settings, copy or bookmark the address bar.</p>
